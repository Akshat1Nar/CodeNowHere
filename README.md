CLI application to create almost any programming language files from your terminal! It's thought to use in any bash or shell, also in IDEs, text editors with console or terminal integrated. The app is developed in C++ and currently is made for Linux Systems. But, with your help and contribution we together could extend this to other type of systems.

## What is the idea?
The idea is to develop a Command Line Interface program for allowing CLI lovers to create their favorites code files wherever directory they are. The file will be generated with a comment header which will contain information about the file and the client. For example, File Name, Date of Creation, Author, and a brief description.

This is a very humble project. I am not using any framework to develop this project. However, you can use *make* to build the project. I am learning while doing, so may be lots of mistakes and errors in designing and coding. I'll be thankful for any recomendation for improving the code.

## How to install
<pre>
clone https://github.com/alucardthefish/CodeNowHere.git
cd CodeNowHere
make
</pre>

After that, you can copy or move the generated executable from the project folder to your bin directory to have access to it from console wherever path you are at.
