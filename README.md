# CodeNowHere
CLI application to create any programming language file!

## What is the idea?
The idea is to develop a Command Line Interface program for allowing CLI lovers to create their favorites code files wherever directory they are. The file will be generated with a comment header which will contain information about the file and the client. For example, File Name, Date of Creation, Author, and maybe a description.
